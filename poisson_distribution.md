### Poisson Distribution

<ins>Introduction</ins><br>
The Poisson Distribution is a type of discrete probability distribution that calculates the <ins>likelihood of a certain number of events happening in a fixed time or space</ins>, assuming the events occur independently and at a constant rate. 
It is characterized by a single paramter $\lambda$ (average rate of occurrence of the event). 
The distribution is used when the events are rare and the number of occurrences is non-negative and can take on integer values(0, 1, 2, 3...) 

<ins>Assumptions</ins><br>
1. Events occur independently of each other
2. The average rate of occurrence $\lambda$ is constant over the given interval
3. The number of events can be any non-negative integer
